## Project Idea 

### Problem Statement

+ Community Center NonProfit Organization (Plaza Comunitaria Durango - PCD) run by local community leaders relies on monetary donations, volunteers and borrowed space to perform its weekly operations. The people that PCD serves are usually older, low income immigrant folks who did not finish schools in their native countries. 
+ Most of the resources PCD allocates is to teach, prepare and inform their 'students' about programs linked with the Mexican government or the city of LA (hosted by the Mexican Consulate). Services include but are not limited to: K-12 online education in Spanish, GED class, Computer literacy, English and U.S. citizenship test prep workshops. Often times, there are also cultural and community events hosted for the people there. 
+ Because PCD is understaffed and somewhat unstructured, the challenge is to keep records and organization of everyone attending and participating in all of its services. To keep potential donors and attract volunteers (usually high school and college students) and justify utility of space, it is essential to keep records and demonstrate with data that PCD is a cause and organization worth keeping and nurturing. 

### Potential Solution

+ As demonstrated in the skill-set targeted for this project, an assistant type website/app where students can sign in and provide their personal information, track their progress and their end result performance (exams pass, grade levels achieved, etc) can provide useful information for the directors to evaluate and leverage. 
+ The assistant can be a duo lingo type app/website while also showcasing relevant graphs and pictures to the students and the directors. Additionally, the app/website can also facilitate community and school related conversations and announcement like Slack or Canvas.
+ The end goal is to help PCD keep track of their services, showcase accomplishments and leverage them and improve in certain areas as they see fit.
